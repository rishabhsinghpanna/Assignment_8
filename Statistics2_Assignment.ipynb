    "1. Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of all the values in a dataset. It is calculated by summing up all the values and then dividing by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) in the dataset because it takes into account every value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.

The median is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean, making it a robust measure of central tendency, especially in datasets with outliers.\n",

    "Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency and dispersion in a dataset. Their presence can distort the calculated values and lead to inaccurate summaries of the data. Here's how outliers affect different measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Mean: Outliers can heavily influence the mean because it takes into account every value in the dataset. If an outlier is significantly higher or lower than the other values, it can pull the mean towards it, causing it to be either inflated or deflated.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Median: The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean. Since the median is the middle value when the data are sorted, it only considers the central values and is not influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "Mode: Outliers typically do not affect the mode because it represents the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. As long as the outlier is not a part of the mode, its presence does not change the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range because it is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. If an outlier is present, it can increase or decrease the range depending on its position relative to the other values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation because they measure the spread of data points from the mean. Since outliers are far from the mean, they contribute to larger deviations, resulting in higher variance and standard deviation."
